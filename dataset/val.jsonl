{"Error Text":"ValueError Output tensors of a Functional model must be the output of a TensorFlow `Layer` (thus holding past layer metadata).","Alignment":"This error occurs in TensorFlow when defining a Functional API model and the specified output tensors are not directly obtained from a TensorFlow `Layer`, indicating the model's outputs must be the result of layer operations to preserve layer metadata; ensure all output tensors are derived from TensorFlow layers."}
{"Error Text":"TypeError tuple expected at most 1 argument, got 2","Alignment":"This error occurs when a function expecting a single tuple argument receives two separate arguments instead, indicating that multiple arguments should be combined into a single tuple or the function call syntax needs adjustment to match the expected input format."}
{"Error Text":"TypeError conv2d() received an invalid combination of arguments - got (tuple, Parameter, Parameter, tuple, tuple, tuple, int), but expected one of:\n * (Tensor input, Tensor weight, Tensor bias, tuple of ints stride, tuple of ints padding, tuple of ints dilation, int groups)","Alignment":"This error indicates a mismatch in the arguments passed to the `conv2d()` function, specifically that the first argument is expected to be a tensor (the input), but a tuple was received instead, suggesting the need to ensure the input is correctly formatted as a tensor and the other arguments match the expected types and order."}
{"Error Text":"ValueError Shapes (None, 1) and (None, 2) are incompatible","Alignment":"This error often arises in machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow or Keras when the shapes of the actual output and the expected output (labels) do not match, typically during model training or evaluation, indicating a mismatch in the number of classes or the output layer's configuration"}
{"Error Text":"ValueError `y` argument is not supported when using dataset as input","Alignment":"This error occurs in TensorFlow or Keras when the `fit` method of a model receives a `y` argument (labels or targets) in addition to a dataset object that already includes the labels, indicating that separate labels should not be provided when the dataset itself contains the input features and corresponding labels."}
{"Error Text":"RuntimeError Pin memory thread exited unexpectedly","Alignment":"This error typically occurs in PyTorch when the background thread responsible for pinning memory (which speeds up data transfer to CUDA devices) exits or crashes unexpectedly, often due to issues in the data loading process; ensure the data loader is correctly configured and stable across multiple epochs."}
