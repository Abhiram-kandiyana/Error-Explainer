Did you mean: 'sam_mask'?","Alignment":"The `NameError` suggests that there is no variable named `gt_mask` defined in the current scope at the time of its reference, and it may be a typo or oversight; resolving it typically involves defining `gt_mask` or correcting the variable name if `sam_mask` was intended."}
{"Error Text":"RuntimeError PytorchStreamReader failed reading zip archive: failed finding central directory","Alignment":"The RuntimeError indicates a problem occurred while trying to read a PyTorch model or data file, likely because the file is corrupted or not a valid zip archive, typically resolved by verifying the file's integrity or re-downloading\/re-creating it."}
{"Error Text":"RuntimeError torch.cat(): expected a non-empty list of Tensors","Alignment":"The RuntimeError occurs because torch.cat() was called with an empty list, and it expects at least one tensor to concatenate, typically resolved by ensuring the list passed to torch.cat() contains one or more tensors."}
{"Error Text":"AttributeError 'list' object has no attribute 'cuda'","Alignment":"The `AttributeError` indicates an attempt to call the `.cuda()` method on a list object, which is not possible because `.cuda()` is a method applicable to PyTorch tensors, not to list objects, typically resolved by applying `.cuda()` to each tensor within the list individually."}
{"Error Text":"ValueError No such layer: fire3_expand2. Existing layers are: ['input_1', 'conv1', 'fire2_squeeze', 'fire2_expand2']","Alignment":"The `ValueError` indicates an attempt to access a layer named `fire3_expand2` that does not exist in the current model architecture, as shown by the list of existing layers, typically resolved by ensuring the correct layer name is used based on the model's defined architecture."}
{"Error Text":"AttributeError shape","Alignment":"The AttributeError: 'shape' typically occurs when trying to access the shape attribute of an object that does not have this attribute, often because the object is not a NumPy array, TensorFlow tensor, or similar data structure that supports shape"}
{"Error Text":"cv2.error OpenCV(4.7.0) :-1: error: (-5:Bad argument) in function 'imwrite' > Overload resolution failed: >  - img data type = 0 is not supported >  - Expected Ptr<cv::UMat> for argument 'img'","Alignment":"The cv2.error indicates that OpenCV's imwrite function failed due to an unsupported image data type, with data type = 0 suggesting the image might be empty or improperly formatted"}
{"Error Text":"ValueError Invalid `beta` argument value. It should be a Python float. Received: beta=2 of type '<class 'int'>'","Alignment":"The ValueError indicates that the beta argument in a function call was expected to be a Python float type, but an integer was provided instead"}
{"Error Text":"AttributeError module 'keras.api._v2.keras.metrics' has no attribute 'FBetaScore'","Alignment":"The AttributeError indicates that the FBetaScore metric is not found within the keras.api._v2.keras.metrics module, possibly due to a typo, incorrect module path, or the metric not being available in the current version of Keras"}
{"Error Text":"TypeError Input type uint16 is not supported","Alignment":"The TypeError: Input type uint16 is not supported occurs when a function or operation is called with an input of data type uint16, which is not handled by that function"}
{"Error Text":"ValueError Error initializing torch.distributed using env:\/\/ rendezvous: environment variable RANK expected, but not set","Alignment":"The ValueError indicates that the initialization of torch.distributed via the env:\/\/ method failed because the required environment variable RANK was not set,"}
{"Error Text":"AttributeError 'tuple' object has no attribute 'reshape'","Alignment":"The AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'reshape' occurs when trying to use the reshape method on a tuple, which is not possible because reshape is a method specific to array-like objects such as NumPy arrays or PyTorch tensors"}
