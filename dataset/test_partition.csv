AttributeError:  'DatasetDict' object has no attribute 'train_test_split',The `AttributeError` occurs because the `DatasetDict` object does not have a `train_test_split` method; you may need to use the `train_test_split` function directly from the library or access individual datasets within the `DatasetDict` to apply splits.
AttributeError:  'functools.partial' object has no attribute '__code__',"The `AttributeError` happens because a `functools.partial` object lacks a `__code__` attribute, which is necessary for operations that require inspecting the function's code, such as serialization or some forms of introspection; use the original function object instead for such operations."
